This package contains a specification language for describing Lua environments.
It is not quite complete and integrated with the rest of the debugger, but
the intention is that Lua frameworks, such as Lua Love, can provide a
specification file describing the types of the various methods they provide,
which can in turn be used by the system to check for correct uses of the
API, and resolving of Lua overloading, which leads to more efficient code.
