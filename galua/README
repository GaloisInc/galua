This package contains the main part of the Lua interpreter, which is
used both by the interpreter and the debugger.  The main modules of
interest are:

  * 'Galua.OpcodeInterpreter', which contains the implementations of
    all Lua byte-codes

  * 'Galua.Stepper', cotains the logic for "punctuated" execution---running
    multiple-opcodes, calling and returning from functions, etc.

  * 'Galua.Overloading' all things related to Lua's overloading features
    (e.g., treating tables like functions, etc)

  * 'Galua.CApi' contains the implementation of the C interface to Lua---
    these are the functions that the Lua interpreter exposes to the C world.
